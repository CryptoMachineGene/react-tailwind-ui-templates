# React + Tailwind UI Templates

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-orange.svg)

A growing collection of clean, reusable UI components built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project serves as a personal component library and dev sandbox for layout exploration, state handling, and Tailwind experimentation.

## Current Components

- ✅ `Navbar` — responsive, mobile-friendly navigation bar with toggle button
- ✅ `DashboardCard` — simple, styled metric card with icon support

## Project Goals

- Create production-ready component scaffolds
- Practice Tailwind layout and spacing systems
- Use as a reference library for future dev projects

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to: http://localhost:5173

Notes
Tailwind manually configured (not using CLI scaffolding due to compatibility issues)

Project uses Vite 7 and React 18

Layout bugs currently under investigation (navbar overlap in fixed layout)
